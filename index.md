# Welcome!

I am an aerospace engineering PhD student at CU Boulder whose research lies at the intersection of formal methods, planning and control of autonomous systems, and machine learning. Currently, I am working with Professor Frew and the [ARIA Systems Group](https://www.ariasystems.group/) led by Professor Lahijanian.

When I am not bringing my thesis across the finish line, I enjoy reading, studying 日本語, and spending time with my family.
